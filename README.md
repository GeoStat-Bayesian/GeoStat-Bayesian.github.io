## Welcome to GeoStat-Bayesian

Recent papers have made the case that statistics in subsurface hydrology is still falling short on available software tools ([Rubin, 2018](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/5675/2018/)) and that Bayesian inference is the most relevant framework for subsurface statistics ([He√üe, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00118/full)). The GeoStat-Bayesian project aims to provide tools for Bayesian inference in gesostatistics and is therefore a timely addition to the R ecosystem of statistical tools.

Currently, the main packages of the project are:

-   exPrior, an R package for deriving prior distributions for geostatistical parameters;
-   anchoredDistr, an R package for Bayesian post-processing, as well as 
-   geostatDB, an R package for geostatistical data.
